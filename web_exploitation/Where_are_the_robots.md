# Where are the Robots
 **Flag:** `picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_8028f}`

 **Step1 :**
 Appeneded a `robots.txt` to the website link.<br>

 **Step2 :**
When i found the disallowed code, i removed the `robots.txt` which i appended and then I appended that code to that link which was `/8028f.html`. This code was basically
something which was not allowed to be visible to everyone for safety purposes.<br>

 **Other incorrect methods I tried:**
 I tried inspecting the webside, looked at the source code and css file but I found nothing.<br>
