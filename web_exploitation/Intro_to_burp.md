# Intro To Burp
**Flag:** `picoCTF{#0TP_Bypvss_SuCc3$S_b3fa4f1a}`<br>

**Step 1:** 
I used burpsuite for this.I kept the intercept off. I opened the browser and tried registering the form.<br>
**Step 2:** 
When it showed `Invalid OTP`,I opened the `HTTP history` in `proxy`.I sent it to repeater.<br>
**Step 3:** 
I opened the repeater and and tried to send it but it showed `Invalid OTP`. I changed the name `otp` to `bin` to remove the 2 factor authetication and I got the flag. <br>
